# Code by caller project type ID

WIP

Each caller project has different needs like

* Different Header file format
* ? Other count of tab characters (not supported)
* ?  (not supported)
* copyright  (not supported)
* .


Project ID helps a 'factory' pattern code to select the matching files

Project ID (?may) set some standard options like no update of manifest files (handled somewhere else ?
